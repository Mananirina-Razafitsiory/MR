				<li> “Automation, Job Destruction, and Monetary policy”, with Nikolaos Charalampidis </li>
				<li> This paper employs estimated automation-based models with households’ heterogeneous disutility 
				of work to examine the short-term effects of firms’ automation decisions (henceforth, automation) 
				on economic fluctuations. The findings reveal that automation lowers the threshold disutility for 
				accepting work, leading to procyclical unemployment, downward wage pressures, and a decline in 
				the labor income share—effects not observed in models with homogeneous disutility of work but consistent 
				with empirical evidence. In an environment without nominal frictions, heterogeneous disutility mitigates 
				automation’s impact on wage rigidity, vacancy volatility, and unemployment volatility while amplifying its 
				effect on reducing the wage-productivity correlation compared to models with homogeneous disutility of work. 
				This mitigation and amplification result from the simultaneous decline in employment and wages triggered by automation.
				Moreover, household heterogeneity reshapes shock transmission, enhancing the role of automation-specific shocks in driving
				economic fluctuations. By integrating nominal rigidities, the model aligns monetary policy shock predictions with observed data
				and demonstrates that the threat of automation heightens the trade-off between inflation and output volatility. 
				Furthermore, we observe a worse trade-off between inflation and unemployment due to the threat of automation.

				<li> To shed light on the causes and consequences of automation decisions, this paper introduces robots replacing workers in a small open economy model 
					with search and matching frictions and capital, estimated for the Canadian economy. A technological factor, the automation-specific technology, 
					drives the probability of a firm to automate and, thereby, generates productivity gains and influences the fluctuations in productivity, investment, 
					and the labor income share. Such a technology triggers a pro-cyclical labor displacement effect that exceeds its job creation effect but the net result 
					on unemployment is quantitatively small, rendering it a small contributing force to unemployment fluctuations. 
					A model with automation decisions fits better the data than models without them, influences the relative importance of  supply-side and labor-market 
					sources of business cycles, yields wage rigidity, and amplifies the volatility of productivity.

				<li> "Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies Under Diagnostic Expectations”, with Zanna Felipe and Elekdag Selim Ali"
				</li>
				</li>
				We develop and estimate a small open economy model with Diagnostic Expectations (DE). DE is a departure from the Rational Expectations (RE) hypothesis which, 
				through an overreaction of agents’ beliefs, generates additional endogenous macroeconomic volatility. We find robust evidence in favor of the DE model which fits 
				the data better than the nested RE alternative. DE has important economic implications as it alters the nature and strength of underlying economic channels. 
				For example, DE can result in shock amplification, and thereby heighted macroeconomic instability. Likewise, the exchange rate channel of monetary policy is more powerful under DE,
				with has implication for policy design. For instance, DE worsens the inflation-output volatility trade-off confronted by policy makers. 
				To help manage this trade-off, optimal monetary policy indicates a role for exchange rate stabilization in the case of DE.
