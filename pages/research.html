				<li> 
				To shed light on the causes and consequences of automation decisions, this paper introduces robots replacing workers in a small open economy model 
				with search and matching frictions and capital, estimated for the Canadian economy. A technological factor, the automation-specific technology, drives
				the probability of a firm to automate and, thereby, generates productivity gains and influences the fluctuations in productivity, investment, and 
				the labor income share. Such a technology triggers a pro-cyclical labor displacement effect that exceeds its job creation effect but the net result 
				on unemployment is quantitatively small, rendering it a small contributing force to unemployment fluctuations. 
				A model with automation decisions fits better the data than models without them, influences the relative importance of  supply-side and 
				labor-market sources of business cycles, yields wage rigidity, and amplifies the volatility of productivity.

				This paper shows that automation-specific productivity shocks affect job creation and destruction differently depending on the structure of 
				the labor market. When job separation is exogenous, the shock mainly increases job creation, leading to a decline in unemployment. 
				However, when separation is endogenous—determined by workers’ heterogeneous disutility of work—the shock causes a larger increase in job destruction 
				than in job creation. As a result, unemployment increases—consistent with empirical findings—since it reflects the excess of job destruction over 
				job creation. The paper also finds that the threat of automation—when the decision to automate is endogenous—worsens the inflation-output gap stabilization 
				trade-off and raises welfare losses, particularly due to the presence of nominal and rigidity frictions. This mechanism necessitates a stronger policy 
				response to output fluctuations within the optimal monetary policy framework. These results highlight the need for monetary policy to account 
				for automation-driven macroeconomic volatility.

				</li>
				We develop and estimate a small open economy model incorporating Diagnostic Expectations (DE)—a departure from the Rational Expectations (RE) 
				hypothesis—where agents' beliefs systematically overreact, generating additional endogenous volatility. Our empirical analysis robustly supports the DE model,
				demonstrating a superior fit relative to the nested RE benchmark. Importantly, DE frameworks deliver enhanced forecasting performance for output and inflation,
				particularly during episodes of significant economic disturbances, such as the Global Financial Crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. The improved empirical 
				performance arises primarily because DE substantially modifies the transmission channels within the economy, amplifying the effects of most shocks and 
				notably strengthening the exchange rate channel of monetary policy. Consequently, DE alters the relative importance of structural shocks influencing 
				key macroeconomic indicators. Taken together, by heightening macroeconomic volatility, DE notably worsens the inflation-output volatility trade-off faced
				by policymakers.
